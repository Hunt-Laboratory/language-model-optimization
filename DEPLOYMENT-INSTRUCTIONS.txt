This file contains high-level instructions for how to deploy
the argument processor on an internal network.

1. 	Host the application code (found in the `D - Code for web
	application` directory) at an internal domain. It is a
	client-side web application and only interacts with the
	language models via an API, so should require no special
	dependencies.

2.	Set up an internal API endpoint for querying the language
	models. For	this you will need:
	- 	the model parameters from the `C - Model parameters`
		directory
	-	some code for loading a model and generating the
		completion of a prompt, which can be modelled closely
		on that given in `B - Code for model training and
		evaluation/gen.ipynb`.

3.	Once you have set up the API endpoint, update the `query()`
	function in the `queryLanguageModel.js` script in the 
	application code, around lines 182 to 186, to point it to
	the internal API endpoint you have set up.

That's about it! Feel free to get in touch with
luke.thorburn@unimelb.edu.au if you have any difficulty.
